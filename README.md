# **Guess the 4-Digit Number**
## **Project Description**
### This project is a Wordle-like game where the user tries to guess a random four digit number (with no duplicates). The user can play as many games as they want, and once they decide to end the game, the console will show game statistics such as average guesses per game and best score. I created this project with the goal of finding the most efficient way to guess a random four digit number, so that I can create another project in the future where the computer guesses a random number that the user comes up with.
## **How To Play**
### After every guess, the computer will tell the user how many digits are correct and how many digits are in the right place. For example, if the number to guess is 1234 and the user guesses 4289, the compuer will print out "2 digits are correct, 1 digit is in the right place" because both 2 and 4 are in the number but only 2 is in the right place.
