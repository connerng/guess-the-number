# **Guess the 4-Digit Number**
## **Project Description**
### This project is a Wordle-like game where the user tries to guess a random four digit number (with no duplicates). The user can play as many games as they want, and once they decide to end the game, the console will show game statistics such as average guesses per game and best score.
